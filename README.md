Employee Base Pay for Montgomery County, Maryland

The project was about showcasing employee base pay all throughout each department bureau
which can help Montgomery County see how employee base pay is being distributed for 
each individual employee in a specific job title to help strategize employee recruitment and retention. 

Used Excel and Structured Query Language (SQL) program to analyze over 230,000 rows of data.
Built a Tableau dashboard to better understand the foundation of compensation.
This leads to both employee and employer to assess the value of each assigned job titles.
